Soundstimbuilder
================

Soundstimbuilder is a python package for creating experimental sound stimuli.

This package is in alpha stage. Do not use yet outside our lab.


Installation
------------
It is best to install in a separate conda environment (see below):

To install the latest development version, use pip with the latest GitHub
master: ::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/gbeckers/soundstimbuilder@master

If you already have an older version installed, you may have to uninstall
first (not sure, but can't hurt): ::

    $ pip uninstall soundstimbuilder

Status
------
Darr is relatively new, and therefore in its alpha stage. It is being used in
practice in the lab, and test coverage is over 90%, but first beta release will
have to wait until test coverage is near 100% and the API is more stable. The
naming of some functions/methods may still change.
