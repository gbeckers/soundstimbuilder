  2019-06-27  1.0     r12 declared as 1.0.
  2019-06-30  1.0.1   Bug fix. Vowels lacked 'aeiouyæø'!
  2019-06-30  1.0.2   Further bug fix. Added in-line diacritics to symbols.
  2019-07-01  1.0.3   More verbose docstrings. Removed optional argument from
                      TextGrid.tier_from_csv().
  2019-07-10  1.1.0   When retain_diacritics=True, Transcript.transcode() now
                      works as it should: in Praat notation, over/understrikes
                      follow the symbol, in Unicode, they precede it. This
                      requires some swapping of characters. This also means
                      that besides ‘diacritics’ variable there are also
                      ‘inline_diacritics’ and ‘index_diacritics’.
  2019-07-11  1.1.1   Separated Transcript in a submodule.
  2019-07-14  1.2.0   Read binary textgrids.
  2020-01-21  1.3.0   Added TextTier as a alternative name for PointTier.
                      AFAIK TextTiers cannot be created in Praat but they do
                      appear in Praat’s documentation so I guess we should
                      take care of them?
  2020-03-23  1.3.1   BUG FIX: Tier.concat() fixed.
